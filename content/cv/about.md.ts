I'm an AI-focused developer with a strong interest in building **robust, system-level AI applications** rather than isolated demos. My work centers on designing modular architectures that combine large language models with long-term memory, reasoning, and real-world interaction.

I primarily work with **Python-based AI systems**, integrating LLMs using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector databases, and custom memory layers. I enjoy building multi-agent setups, experimenting with different orchestration strategies, and optimizing context and memory flow for long-running agents.

Beyond model interaction, I focus heavily on **practical integration**—connecting AI systems to operating systems, APIs, and external tools to make them actually useful in day-to-day environments. I’m especially interested in AI that can reason over past experiences, adapt over time, and operate autonomously within defined constraints.

## Core Focus
- AI system architecture and orchestration  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Long-term and contextual memory systems  
- Multi-agent and tool-augmented AI  

## Interests
- Large Language Models and agent frameworks  
- AI memory optimization and retrieval strategies  
- Autonomous and semi-autonomous agents  
- Security-aware AI tooling
